# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces all mock data throughout the SV Viktoria Wertheim website with real data from Supabase. Currently, only the HomePage is integrated with Supabase, while other pages (News, Teams, Contact, Shop) and components (LeagueTableModal, TeamStatus) still use hardcoded mock data. This integration will provide dynamic content management and ensure data consistency across the entire application.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the website's goal of being a modern, data-driven platform for the football club by:
- Enabling real-time content updates without code changes
- Providing a single source of truth for all club data
- Allowing non-technical staff to manage content through Supabase
- Ensuring consistency across all pages and components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: News Page Supabase Integration

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see real news articles from the database, so that I get current club information

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the news page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all news articles from Supabase
2. IF no news articles exist in the database THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
3. WHEN a user clicks on a news article THEN the system SHALL display the full article from Supabase data
4. WHEN searching or filtering news THEN the system SHALL query Supabase with appropriate filters

### Requirement 2: Teams Page Database Integration

**User Story:** As a club member, I want to see current team rosters and statistics from the database, so that I have accurate team information

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the teams page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all team data from Supabase including players, coaches, and statistics
2. IF a team is selected THEN the system SHALL display players and match results from the database
3. WHEN viewing youth teams THEN the system SHALL display all youth team information from Supabase
4. IF team data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully with fallback content

### Requirement 3: Contact Page Dynamic Data

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see current contact information, so that I can reach the right person

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contact page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all contact persons from Supabase
2. IF contact information changes in the database THEN the system SHALL reflect updates on next page load
3. WHEN displaying social media links THEN the system SHALL use URLs from the database

### Requirement 4: League Table Modal Integration

**User Story:** As a fan, I want to see current league standings, so that I know my team's position

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the league table modal opens THEN the system SHALL fetch current standings from Supabase
2. IF multiple leagues exist THEN the system SHALL fetch the correct league based on team selection
3. WHEN standings data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate loading or error state

### Requirement 5: Team Status Component Integration

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see real-time team statistics on the homepage, so that I get quick insights

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TeamStatus component renders THEN the system SHALL display statistics from Supabase
2. IF team selection changes THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the correct team's statistics
3. WHEN statistics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle missing data gracefully

### Requirement 6: Shop Page Future Integration

**User Story:** As a club supporter, I want the shop to be ready for product data, so that I can eventually purchase merchandise

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shop page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain its "Coming Soon" status
2. IF product data becomes available in Supabase THEN the system SHALL be ready to display it
3. WHEN the shop launches THEN the system SHALL fetch products from the database

### Requirement 7: NewsCarousel Fallback Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove mock data fallbacks, so that the application only uses real data

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NewsCarousel receives no data THEN the system SHALL display an empty state instead of mock data
2. IF Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message rather than fallback data
3. WHEN data loads successfully THEN the system SHALL only display Supabase content

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should only handle its own data fetching
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable Supabase query functions in /lib/supabase/
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize direct Supabase client usage in components
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all Supabase data structures

### Performance
- Server-side data fetching for initial page loads (Server Components)
- Implement proper caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use parallel data fetching where possible with Promise.all()
- Limit query results with proper pagination

### Security
- All database queries must respect Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- No sensitive data should be exposed in client components
- API keys and credentials must remain in environment variables

### Reliability
- Implement proper error boundaries for data fetching failures
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Include retry logic for failed database connections
- Maintain application functionality even with partial data availability

### Usability
- Loading states must be shown during data fetching
- Empty states should provide clear messaging
- Data should be formatted consistently across all pages
- German language content must be properly displayed with UTF-8 encoding
